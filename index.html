      My research mainly focuses on solving optimization problems in the real world of engineering. I am currently specializing in the field of Operations Research (OR) and I am doing my research on Linear Programming (LP), Mixed Integer Programming
      (MIP) and Constraint Programming (CP). I am gaining my knowledge and expertise in these concepts by applying them to solve real-world and complex optimization problems like Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). I will
      elaborate on my current research below.
    </p>
    <p class="content-details">
      Typically, in real world applications, the routing of the unmanned vehicles (UAVs) involve several constraints and thus making the optimization of a fleet of such vehicles' route becomes more complex. For example, in case of large-scale
      scenarios where the vehicle needs to travel a lot of distance needs refueling and thus having a constraint. Similarly there are other constraints such as time window constraints, distance constraints and so on. And hence this attracts a lot of
      researchers to solve such problems thereby making VRP and TSP one of the most extensively solved problems in the field of Operations Research. But, even in literature, solving such UAV problems involve refueling only on a fixed location where
      UAVs refuel and proceed on its route. In my problem, there is an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) that moves and also serves as a refueling vehicle for UAVs. This kind of vehicle which moves and also serves as a moving refueling depot adds up
      another layer of complexity to solve for the optimization as both the vehicles' route are to be optimized. My research involves solving this complex problem by developing heuristics that are capable of solving such problems.

    <p class="content-details">
      Being a mechanical engineering student, my undergraduate research was mainly focused on Design and Material analysis. For instance, I did a research project on design and analysis of blade profiles that are used for Vertical Axis Wind Turbines.
      Its application mainly involved using such apparatus on the highway roads to tap electricity from the moving vehicles. I was also interested and performed research in studying the material properties that are used for such applications.

      I will list out my publications below that are related to my field of research.
